  The function of this project is to make an application that will produce professional grade README files. The application will ask the user questions and from their response it will form the content of the file. The README will include the title, an icon of the chosen license, a table of contents, a description of the project, installation steps, usage guide, questions section with contact information and finally the license used. When finished, it will create a new file in the current directory that is ready to be used.
